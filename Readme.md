## Interface lab 2020

This document tries to document best hardware practices using Unity and Arduino.


**Software tested:** Unity version 2019.3.14f1, [Ardity] (https://github.com/dwilches/Ardity)

**OS tested:** macOS Mojave 10.14.6 and Windows 10 Pro 64bits

**Microcontrollers tested:** Arduino UNO, Arduino Nano IOT 33, ESP8266 NodeMCU, ESP32

**Hardware tested:** IMU BNO-055, Neopixels WS2812, servoMotors, LEDs, Analog Potentiometers

These examples were developed to explain useful ways that Arduino and Unity can communicate with each other. 
**Prototype 1** From Arduino to Unity

**Prototype 2** From Unity to Arduino

**Prototype 3** Arduino and Unity talking to each other (Full Duplex)
